# Sbomit

Generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) from Witness attestations.

## Overview

`sbomit` parses witness attestation files and generates SBOMs in SPDX or CycloneDX format. It:
- Extracts files from attestation types
- Resolves files to packages using ecosystem-specific resolvers (Python, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Filters out package files already listed as packages
- Supports multiple SBOM output formats

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/absol27/sbomit@latest
```

## Usage

```bash
sbomit generate --attestation attestation.json

--attestation string    Path to witness attestation file (required)
--output string         Output file path (default: stdout)
--format string         Output format: spdx22, spdx23, cdx14, cdx15 (default: "spdx23")
--name string           Application name (default: "sbomit-sbom")
--version string        Application version (default: "0.0.1")
--author strings        Author(s) - can be repeated
--types strings         Attestation types to process (default: material,command-run,product)
--catalog string        Cataloger to run before processing attestations (supported: syft)
--project-dir string    Project directory to scan with the cataloger (defaults to current directory)
```

## Syft Catalog Option

Sbomit outputs a flat list of dependencies. If the SBOM metadata syft derives includes dependency structure, using syft first can help preserve more relationship context.

Example:

```bash
sbomit generate --attestation attestation.json --catalog syft --project-dir /path/to/project
```

## Development

### Attestation Extractors

Modular extractors for different attestation types:
- `MaterialExtractor` - Build Input materials
- `CommandRunExtractor` - Opened files from processes
- `ProductExtractor` - Built artifacts

Implement `Extractor` interface to add new types.

### Resolvers

Ecosystem-specific package resolvers that extract packages from file paths:
- `PythonResolver` - Resolves from `site-packages/`, `dist-packages/`, `.dist-info`
- `GoResolver` - Resolves from module cache paths under `pkg/mod/`
- `RustResolver` - Resolves from Cargo registry paths
- `JavaScriptResolver` - Resolves pnpm-style paths under `node_modules/.pnpm/`

Each resolver implements `Resolver` and optionally `PackageFileFilterer` to filter its own package files.

### Processing Pipeline

```
Attestation → Extract Files → Filter Cache Files → 
Run Resolvers → Filter Package Files → Generate SBOM
```

## Testing

```bash
go run . generate --attestation test/sample-attestation.json
```
